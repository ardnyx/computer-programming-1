# Computer Programming 1

This repository will be utilized for pushing the activities in here, which will serve as a progression tracker and reviewer.

For those who will use this as a reviewer, there is no need to download anything. You can download them naman, pero I'm not sure how.
If you know how to download, **__make sure to use the latest version of Visual Studio**__
You can view the codes of each project by doing the following:


1. Clicking the folder of the respective machine problem (MP#)
