I have also added others' programs in here para makita niyo rin on what techniques others use, or how they methodize. *See Ignacio.cs on MP4 - Practice Exam/Combination*

This repository will be utilized for pushing the activities in here, which will serve as a progression tracker and reviewer. 
We will only upload the Machine Problems **__only 1 day after the deadline has passed__** to avoid copying.

For those who will use this as a reviewer, there is no need to download anything, kasi yung Program.cs files lang ang pinush ko dito and not the executable .sln files of Visual Studio.

You can view the codes of each project by doing the following:

# PC / Mobile
1. Click the folder of the respective machine problem (MP#). For mobile users, pindutin nyo yung "View Code" if hindi niyo makita.

2. Navigate to the respective project folder (if there is any)
3. Click the **Program.cs** file
